# Bioinformatics Institute project "Comparative transcriptomic analysis of the abdominal ganglia of the hermit crab *Pagurus minutus*, healthy and infected with *Peltogaster reticulata* ("Crustacea": Rhizocephala)"

Rhizocephala ("Crustacea": Cirripedia) are singular and highly specialised obligate endoparasites. Profound adaptations to the endoparasitic lifestyle have affected many aspects of the rhizocephalan biology. The gross morphology, physiology and life cycles of these parasites have undergone strong modification. Despite significant morphological simplifications, rhizocephalans have gained a number of specific regulatory mechanisms allowing them to take control of the host body. Parasitic barnacles are capable of modifying the morphology, hormonal and physiological status, as well as the behaviour of the infected host. The specialised rhizocephalan rootlets penetrating the host's ganglia have a significant role in the interaction between the parasite and the host.
The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has made it possible to study in detail the molecular basis of host-parasite interplay. However, to date, no molecular data relating to the interactions of basal family rhizocephalans with their hermit crab hosts are publicly available. 
The aim of this project is to conduct a comparative transcriptomic analysis of the ganglia of male and female *Pagurus minutus* hermit crab, both healthy and infected with the rhizocephalan *Peltogaster reticulata*. We have also attempted to assembly the parasite genome to reveal genomic adaptations to parasitism in Rhizocephala. 

## Differential transcriptome analysis

### Methods

#### Data reformatting

BBMap/BBTools (v. 39.01) was used to ID correction of reads and filtering of rnaSPAdes results. Scripts are available in the repository.
